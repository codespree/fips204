Figure-of-merit only; no particular care has been taken to disable turbo-boost etc.
Note that constant-time restrictions on the implementation do impact performance.

Additional performance optimizations are on the roadmap. Near-obvious uplift can be 
had with more careful modular multiplication & addition using fewer reductions. Also, 
'u16' arithmetic has an x86 performance penalty.
